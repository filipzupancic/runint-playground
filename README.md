# RUNINT Playground 🛝

This repository serves as a **sandbox and verification environment** for the [RUNINT](https://github.com/your-org/runint) library. 

It allows you to:
1.  Test **Run Configs** (JSON/YAML) locally.
2.  Verify **Docker Deployment** generation.
3.  Run **Benchmarks** against local engines (Ollama, vLLM).

## 📂 Structure

* `configs/`: Contains sample Run Configurations (e.g., `local_ollama.json`).
* `results/`: Stores the output benchmarks (CSVs/JSONs).
* `run_demo.sh`: A one-click script to deploy and benchmark.

## 🚀 Setup

### Prerequisites
* Docker & Docker Compose installed and running.
* Python 3.10+.
* The `runint` source code cloned in a neighboring directory.

### Installation (Local Dev Mode)

You have two options depending on whether you are a user or a developer.

#### Option A: User Mode (Install from PyPI)
Use this if you just want to run the playground and benchmarks without modifying the core library code.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install the published library
pip install runint
```

#### Option B: Developer Mode (Install from Source)
Use this if you are developing the runint library and want to test your changes live. This assumes you have the runint repo cloned in a neighboring directory.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment:
    
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install RunInt in "Editable" mode:
This links this project directly to your local `runint` source code. Any change you make in the library is immediately reflected here.

# Assumes runint is located at ../runint
pip install -e ../runint
```

## 🛠 Usage

### Option 1: The Automated Demo
Run the shell script to deploy a standardized Ollama setup and run a translation benchmark.
```bash
chmod +x run_demo.sh
./run_demo.sh
```
### Option 2: Manual Control

1. Deploy the Environment Read the config and spin up containers:

```bash
runint deploy --config configs/local_ollama.json
```

2. Check Benchmarks See what benchmarks are available in your library:

```bash
runint info
```

3. Run a Benchmark Execute a test against the running engine:

```bash
runint benchmark --task translation_en_de_v1 --model llama3 --iterations 5
```

## 🧹 Cleanup

To stop the Docker containers generated by the playground:

```bash
docker compose down
```
